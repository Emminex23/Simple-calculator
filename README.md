# Calculator Function
This is a JavaScript function that performs basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers based on the selected operator (+, -, *, /). The result is then displayed in an output field.

## Usage
To use this function, follow these steps:

1. Add the HTML code to your webpage where you want the calculator to appear

2. Add the JavaScript code to your webpage or include it in a separate file

3. Test the calculator function by inputting two numbers and selecting one of the four operators (+, -, *, /).

## Bug Fixes
One potential bug in this code is that it doesn't handle the case where the user inputs an invalid operator, such as a symbol or a string that is not one of the four recognized operators. To fix this bug, an additional conditional statement has been added to display an error message if the input operator is invalid.
